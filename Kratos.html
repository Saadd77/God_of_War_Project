        <h1>Kratos <br>The God Of War</h1>
        <p>Born in the Greek city-state of Sparta, Kratos is the demigod son of the King of the Gods, Zeus, and a mortal woman named Callisto. Because of this, he has an incredible intellect, superhuman strength, and powerful prowess. Although, he would remain unaware of who his father was for most of his life. Outraged at Zeus for fathering yet another bastard child, Hera ordered Kratos' execution on the day he was born, but the King of the Gods took pity on the child and refused, leaving him in Sparta to be raised by Callisto.</p>
