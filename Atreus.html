        <h1>Atreus <br>Loki, God Of Mischief</h1>
        <p>Loki is the wily trickster god who is neither good nor evil as he both helps and causes problems across the Nine Realms. Loki's mischiefs varies from loony antics to prophesied apocalypses as he is the main cause of starting Ragnarök.<br>Eventually, Loki had a falling out with the Norse gods when he orchestrated Höðr killing Baldr with a mistletoe arrow. Angered by Loki, the Norse gods decided to punish him which led to him fleeing and hiding in Midgard before he eventually was captured near the lake, Franangrsfors in the form of a salmon.</p>
